# Audio Law

Audio Law was developed to address the static and often dense nature of legal documentation. The project aims to make the legal system more dynamic by providing an audio-first platform where laws, decrees, and regulations are translated into clear, narrated content. This allows users to consume essential legal information during commutes, exercise, or as a primary accessibility tool.
